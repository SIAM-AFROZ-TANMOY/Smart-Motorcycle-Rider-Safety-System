# 🚀 About the Project

**Helmet Detectors** is an AI-based smart motorcycle helmet developed to improve rider safety through continuous monitoring, intelligent detection and emergency response.

The system integrates multiple sensors and modules into a **3D-printed helmet body**. It combines an **ESP32 DevKit**, **ESP32-CAM**, **RFID**, **MPU6050**, **MQ-3 alcohol sensor**, **GPS**, **LDR**, **OLED display**, **buzzer**, and other supporting components.

The project provides four major safety functions:

1. **AI-Based Helmet and Rider Detection**
2. **Intelligent Rider Safety and Monitoring**
3. **Accident Detection and Emergency Response**
4. **Driver/Rider Drowsiness Detection and Alert**

The completed prototype was physically assembled on a 3D-printed helmet body, with the electronic components mounted directly on the helmet.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To develop an intelligent helmet-based rider safety system.
- To detect whether the rider is wearing a helmet.
- To identify visible signs of rider drowsiness.
- To authenticate the rider using RFID.
- To monitor alcohol levels.
- To detect possible motorcycle accidents.
- To provide a short cancellation period after accident detection.
- To obtain the accident location using GPS.
- To send emergency notifications remotely.
- To provide local warnings through a buzzer.
- To display important system information through an OLED display.
- To monitor environmental light conditions.
- To integrate all major safety features into a single wearable prototype.

# ⭐ Key Features

## 🤖 1. AI-Based Helmet & Rider Detection

The ESP32-CAM captures the rider's image and sends it to the AI/VLM-based processing system.

The system checks:

- Whether a rider is visible.
- Whether a helmet is being worn.
- Whether the rider appears drowsy.
- Eye condition/state.
- Confidence of the AI result.
- Additional detection notes.

The result is then returned to the ESP32-CAM and used by the main system.

## 🛡️ 2. Intelligent Rider Safety & Monitoring

The helmet continuously monitors several rider and environmental conditions.

### Monitoring includes:

- 🍺 Alcohol level
- 💡 Ambient light
- 🪪 Rider authentication
- 📍 GPS information
- 📺 OLED status
- 🔊 Local buzzer alerts
- 📊 Real-time dashboard information

## 🪪 3. RFID-Based Rider Authentication

The original project proposal specified a fingerprint sensor.

However, in the **final implementation**, the fingerprint sensor was replaced with an:

> **RC522 RFID Module**

An authorized RFID tag is used to authenticate the rider and control the safety system.
